					<h3> Individual Round </h3>
					<p> Just like the MIT Integration Bee, you will solve challenging integrals (and similar problems) at a whiteboard head-to-head against your competitor. Fastest correct answer wins! The tournament will take place with a single-elimination bracket consisting of matches of up to fifteen minutes. All integrals can be solved with an AP Calculus BC level of knowledge, but will often require ingenuity and clever tricks under time pressure.</p>
				</div>

					<h3> Team Round </h3>
					<p> Bring a team of up to four students (if you don't have a team, we'll make one for you) into a fast-paced mashup of all sorts of calculus problems and calculus-themed trivia. Teams will start with a quizbowl-style "CalculusBowl" and finish with a problem set relay race (similar to BMT's "guts round"). Some of the problems here will be similar to individual round problems, but we will also include limits, series, and other calculus problems to spice it up. </p>
